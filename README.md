# ToDo App
This is a project for my NuCamp Backend course. I am attempting to create a Django application that can serve as a To Do list for multiple users.
## Features | WIP
- Login to view your tasks.
- Show tasks sorted by how soon they are due.
- Request a task to be assigned to another user.
- Change the due date on a task.
